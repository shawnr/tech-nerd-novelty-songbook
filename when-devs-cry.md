```[intro] 
Am G Em F G

[1st Verse]
Am                    G
Dig if you will these page comps
    Em                     F  G
Of a site as amazing as this.
Am                         G
It’s got the stuff that we need and want.
Em
Can you Web Dev,
 F              G
Can you picture this?

Am                    G
Dream if you can a website
    Em                    F   G
Responsive to all of your screens.
Am              G
I’ve tested usability all week,
Em
We see the heat,
     F                G
The heatmaps of their gaze.

[Chorus]
Am                           G
How can we build out this website?
Em                            F   G
Stuck with this tech that's so old? (So old)
Am                    G
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Em                               F     G
Maybe I'm just like the <strong> tag: too bold
Am                          G
Maybe you're just like my manager
Em              F    G
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Am                        G
Why do we scream at each other?
Em
This is what it sounds like
 F     G
When devs cry.

[Break]
Am G Em F G

[Verse 2]
Am                      G
Touch if you will this ECMAscript:
Em                     F   G
See how I patched it inside?
Am                    G
We can inject Web Components
Em
Let’s use Webpack,
F     G
Even devs have pride.


[Chorus]
Am                           G
How can we build out this website?
Em                          F   G
Stuck with this tech that's so old? (So old)
Am                    G
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Em                               F     G
Maybe I'm just like the <strong> tag: too bold
Am                          G
Maybe you're just like my manager
Em              F    G
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Am                        G
Why do we scream at each other?
Em
This is what it sounds like
 F     G
When devs cry.

Am G Em F G 

[Outro] 
Em
This is what it sounds like
F     G
When devs cry

Well-I-guess-it-would-be-nice if I could build a website:
                D                                           A            
Help you post a blog or book a flight, or maybe order some shoes.
                        A                
But I've got to think twice before I code my nights away
            D                                          A      
And I know all the bills you pay because I pay them too
         
          D                        A 
Oh, but you need someone who can write your website,
D                                  A                                        
And you know I can do all that and more.
              D                   A                          
But when employers call and offer compensation
          Bm                              E  
I’m not gonna give you two weeks, I’m just walking out the door.

[Chorus]                                       
                     A                A
‘Cause I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
                    A
Because I gotta get paid, paid, paid
            A
I gotta get paid, paid, a-paid ah

[Verse]
A
BABY, you know I studied JavaScript
                     D  
So I could build this site, so slick,
                            A 
That it would get a million views.

A              
MAYBE, I should have used React or Vue, 
                D
But I stuck with everything I knew,
                 A                 
And now I’m all tied up with Angular blues.

[Bridge]
  D                A 
Before this repo becomes a website
  D                               A
Before you go and buy your Google AdWords
            D                  A     
Oh-baby- please consider this foolish invoice
        Bm                                E
Well I need the job experience, but I'll wait for something more:

[Chorus]
                   A               A
Yes, I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid
                    A           A
Because I gotta get paid, paid, paid
            A
I gotta get paid, paid, a-paid ah

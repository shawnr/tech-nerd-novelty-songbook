[Intro]
C  Am  C  Am
[Verse]
      C                 Am
Now I've heard there was a secret code
     C                   Am
That I could type and this site would load
    F                G               C           G
But I don't really know how this stuff works yet.
   C                   F           G
It goes like this: the tags, the ‘tribs,
    Am              F
The C-S-S, the JavaScript,
    G                E           Am
The baffled dev repeating, “Hope it works, yeah.”

[Chorus]
     F                    Am                   F
Hope it works, yeah! Hope it works, yeah! Hope it works, yeah!
        C     G     C        G
Hope it wor - or - or -orks!

[Verse]
     C                        Am
Your mark-up’s strong but you needed more,
    C               Am
You styled the pseudo-select “:before,”
    F          G          C     G
To put an icon onto every item.
    C           F     G
You added every meta tag,
    Am                       F
The viewport zoom, the Open Graph,
    G                  E             Am
And in the dark you whisper, “Hope it works, yeah!”

[Chorus]
        F                    Am                   F
Hope it works, yeah! Hope it works, yeah! Hope it works, yeah!
        C     G        C     G
Hope it wor - or - or -orks!


[Verse]

    C              Am
You say it’s not accessible,
       C            Am
So I went to Stack Overflow,
    F            G                    C        G
To ask about the way that this should go-o.
          C            F     G
The tabindex, the skip links, too,
   Am             F
I added them all in for you:
    G                E                         Am
And now I hope that this site will start to work, yeah!

[Chorus]
     F                    Am                   F
Hope it works, yeah! Hope it works, yeah! Hope it works, yeah!
        C     G    C     G
Hope it wor - or - or -orks!


[Verse]

  C               Am
I did my best, it wasn't much,
  C               Am
I fixed it so it works with touch.
     F             G            C       G
I've optimized and tested every view.
    C                F           G
And even though some things went wrong,
   Am                  F
I fixed those bugs and carried on,
     G             E              Am
And now I see it’s working, Hallelujah!

[Chorus]
     F           Am          F
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
     C  G C     G
Hallelu - jah.

Am                    G
We stood up and we never sat down,
         D                                      Am
Had a good lookin' webapp in our first go-round
          Am                           G
We had requirements docs and and comps just right.
                D                          Am
We talked Kanban and Scrum, planned Agile all night.

Well, we got off the rails when the sales team
       D                                  Am
Gave demos to clients of the beauty they’d seen.
         Am                              G
The clients were psyched and started feature requestin’
              D                        Am
We tried to hold the line, but chaos was destined.
   G           D
...chaos was destined.

Deployment’s scheduled for tonight and, oh no, 
                       A     G
I just found another bug!

<pre>
Am                     G
Some dev committed broken code
D                           Am
That sent us back to triage mode.
Am                                G
I'm tired of writing tests, this site keeps going down
D                             Am
I'm tired of use cases, I'm tired of Markdown.
Am            G
oh my my, oh hell yes
D                   Am
Our Integration’s Continuous.
Am                    G
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
D                          Am
Keep me at work, I’ve been here so long

There's tofu in our content now,
D                        Am
Someone pasted from Word somehow.
Am                     G
Lookin' down at a column of code
D                   Am
I feel like my head will explode.
Am                   G
Oh my my, oh hell yes
D                       Am
This issue management system’s a mess.
Am                          G
It was too cold to cry when we launched at 3,
D                             Am
Closed out the last issue: Works For Me.

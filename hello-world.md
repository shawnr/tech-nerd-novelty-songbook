Verse One:\
  Em  G D  C\
Hello, it's me.\

I was wondering if after all these Sprints you'd like to meet

     Em G D C

to go o-ver every Feature. They say\
    Em G\
that User Story's not complete,\
    D              C\
but I ain't got new Specs yet.\
  Em  G D C\
Hello, can you hear me?\
      Em G D C\
This video chat's breaking up, but I think I heard you say

        Em G D    C

that you wan-ted to bump Re-lease.\
     Em G D C\
I've forgotten how it felt before when sometimes I would sleep.

Pre-Chorus:\
               Em D C\
There's such a long list of features\
     Em D C\
and a short number of days.

Chorus:\
Em C G  D\
Hello from the website.

   Em C G D

I've got this thing looking alright. I've got the\
Em C                 G D\

Em C G D

 logged in, you get prompts to monetize.\
 Em C G  D\

Launch day came and went and nothing really broke. I'm happy.\

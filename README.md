# A few words about silly songs...

The songs in this book are part of a tradition that goes back to the Sigma Tau Delta English Honor Society at the University of Idaho. As part of events under then-President of the Honor Society, Dr. Trish Henley, we wrote and performed several parody songs. We injected joy and harmony and group expression of both accomplishment and hardship into our events, ceremonies, and meetings through music. By singing together, and especially by singing silly songs together, we were able to come together more as a group.

When working with Dr. Henley to create the School of New and Continuing Studies at Seattle University, we wanted to resurrect our tradition of singing silly songs together. Our first program was the Web Development Certificate, which involves a year \(at least\) of difficult, dedicated study. It is a rigorous program, and students must invest immense amounts of time and energy into completing the requirements. Along the way, there are plenty of ups and downs, so it seemed fitting to celebrate and move through those feelings by singing together at graduation ceremonies.

We continue to graduate groups from the Web Development Certificate, and soon we will begin graduating students from other programs \(Digital Technology and Cultures as well as Organizational Leadership\). We intend to keep writing songs, and whenever I'm able I will continue to archive them here.

This book will grow along with the school.

Check back occasionally for updates. Thanks for looking at these songs. You are free to perform, record, or republish these songs as you'd like. They are released under an MIT License.

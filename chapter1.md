# **I Will Survive \(This Program\)**

Parody of “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor

Am Dm G C F Bm Em E

**Verse 1**

Am Dm

At first I was afraid, I was petrified.

G C

I kept thinking I could never code without you by my side.

F Bm

Then I spent so many days, and I worked hard through all the nights.

Em E

I grew strong. I learned how to build these sites!

Am Dm

I learned to write my markup with the proper flair,

G C

And how assistive devices help you see what all’s in there.

F Bm

I learned about the DOM and all about requests,

Em E

I learned how to make the user feel like a welcome guest.

**Chorus**

Am Dm

Oh, I... I will survive!

G C

As long as I know how to code, I know I’ll stay alive.

F Bm

I spent all this freakin’ year learning all these freakin’ skills,

Em E

and I’ll be using all this knowledge to pay my freakin’ bills!

Am Dm

And I, I will survive!

G C

As long as I know Javascript, I know I’ll be alright.

F Bm

I’ve got a job that I enjoy, I’ve got websites to deploy.

Em E

I will survive! I will survive, yeah!

**Verse 2**

Am Dm

So I’ll just go, walk out the door.

G C

I’ve got three interviews today, and tomorrow I’ve got more.

F Bm

\(I’ve got an issue here with Github ‘cause I changed my crypto key,

Em E

but I can make it work again using SSH-KEYGEN!\)

Am Dm

So if you see me with a site that’s new,

G C

I’m not that noobish little dev using Weebly to fool you.

F Bm

I’m writing Javascript, and I’m consuming APIs,

Em E

and I’ve really got no time to do a job for free tonight!

**Chorus**

Am Dm

Oh, I... I will survive!

G C

As long as I know how to code, I know I’ll stay alive.

F Bm

I spent all this freakin’ year learning all these freakin’ skills,

Em E

and I’ll be using all this knowledge to pay my freakin’ bills!

Am Dm

And I, I will survive!

G C

As long as I know Javascript, I know I’ll be alright.

F Bm

I’ve got a job that I enjoy, I’ve got websites to deploy.

Em E

I will survive! I will survive, yeah!

**Repeat Chorus, End.**
